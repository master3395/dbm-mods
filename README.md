| Extensions | [Download](https://dbm-network.github.io/download-git/#/home?url=https://github.com/dbm-network/mods/tree/master/extensions) |

2.  In the top bar of Discord Bot Maker, click Project → Open Directory of your corresponding package (e.g. Open Actions Directory)
3.  Extract the contents of the .zip file into the folder you just opened
    (Overwrite existing files if asked)

To install extensions you need to move the .js file from the extension folder and place it directly into the extensions folder for your project.

**You will need to repeat this process for all of your projects**
